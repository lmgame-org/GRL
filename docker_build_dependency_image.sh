# This scripts takes a docker image that already contains the GRL dependencies, copies the local source code in and
# uploads that image into GCR. Once in GCR the docker image can be used for development.

# Each time you update the base image via a "bash docker_build_dependency_image.sh", there will be a slow upload process
# (minutes). However, if you are simply changing local code and not updating dependencies, uploading just takes a few seconds.

# Script to buid a GRL base image locally, example cmd is:
# bash docker_build_dependency_image.sh
# bash docker_build_dependency_image.sh --vllm
set -e

# Set default values
